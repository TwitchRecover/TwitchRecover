# Twitch Recover

### Twitch Recover is a free tool that allows you to view, recover and download all types of Twitch videos (VODs, clips, streams and highlights).
  
### There are two current versions available, the alpha of the 2.0 version which has 17 different features and the 1.2 version which is the last current stable version.  
**If you use the 2.0 alpha and experience an issue, please report the issue so I can fix it for the beta and final releases.**  

### Twitch has just started fully deleting a greater percentage of VODs also from their VOD servers when a streamer deletes the VOD. If you cannot find a VOD it is because that one has fallen fate to Twitch's updated deletion process.

## 2.0 Alpha Guide:  
  
### Installation:  
**For Windows users please use the installer.**
**For linux and MacOS users, please download the JAR and run it.**
  
1. Download the installer: [https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover/releases/download/2.0aH/Twitch.Recover.Setup.exe](https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover/releases/download/2.0aH/Twitch.Recover.Setup.exe)
2. Run and install the installer.
3. Launch Twitch Recover.
4. Enjoy.

### Can't play M3U8!

You just retrieved a VOD or highlight but when you paste it into VLC it won't load or you can't watch the whole video.
   
#### Check if it has muted segments. Use option 9 of Twitch Recover to check if the video is muted/has muted segments.   
#### If it does, use option 10 to unmute the video and then open that new M3U8 file in VLC and you can watch it. 
  
#### If the M3U8 still won't play, please create a Github issue so I can look into the issue.

This is caused by how the playlist of Twitch M3U8 videos which have muted segments are structured. 
This results in when you try playing those muted segments in VLC (or other video player), it won't be able to reach it and cause it to be unable to play it.  
When unmuted using Twitch Recover, simply open the file in VLC or other similar video players and you should be able to watch it as usual.  
   
### Wfuzz

**If you are attempting to recover clips from a stream, PLEASE utilise the Wfuzz integration and use Wfuzz.**   
**It will shorten your recovery time from literal hours to a couple of minutes.**
**Not using Wfuzz is very heavily unrecommended.**  
   
#### To install and setup Wfuzz for integration with Twitch Recover, please follow the instructions that are on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover/wiki/Wfuzz-Integration).
**- Wfuzz Integration wiki page: [https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover/wiki/Wfuzz-Integration](https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover/wiki/Wfuzz-Integration).**  
**- Wfuzz Integration video tutorial: [https://youtu.be/ZldxgvOrsDE](https://youtu.be/ZldxgvOrsDE).**

## 1.2 Guide:
  
### Installation:
1. Download the exe file for your desired version.
    - [Graphical (GUI) Version (WIP, coming soon)]()
    - [Command Line Version](https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover/releases/download/1.2/TwitchRecover-CLI-v1.2.exe)
2. Run the exe. **Ignore the Windows Defender popup, click more info and run anyway. It is a certificate issue, not a security issue.**
3. Paste the result URL into VLC or another similar video client.

### Guide:
### Using a Twitch Tracker link:
**You can use the Twitch Tracker link of a stream to directly get the VOD links.**  
**Links must be in the following format: twitchtracker.com/[streamer]/streams/[stream ID]**  
i.e. https://twitchtracker.com/tayarics/streams/40715936990  

Select option 2 and paste the link and you will get the VOD links.

#### Manually inputting the stream information:
1. Select option 1.
2. Input the streamer's name.
3. Input the Stream ID.  
    **The unique Stream ID, not what comes after 'videos/...'.** You can get it a variety of ways but the simplest are using Twitch Tracker or Sully Gnome, they are the string of digits in the stream page's URL.
4. Enter the timestamp of the start of the stream in the 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' format.

#### Brute forcing the seconds:
**Only use this option when you do not have the time in seconds of the stream's start, only the time up to minutes.**
1. Select option 3.
2. Input the streamer's name.
3. Input the Stream ID **(the disclaimer in bold right above also applies)**.
4. Input the timestamp in the same format but set the seconds value to 00.
    **'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:00'**
